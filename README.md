# StackOverflowAPI-iOSConsumer

Just a simple JSON consumer for the [Stack Overflow API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs) built on iOS using Core Data for offline storage.

To test the offline storage, terminate the app after downloading the user list and relaunch it in airplane mode.

No third-party libraries used.
